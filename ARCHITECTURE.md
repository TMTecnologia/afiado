# Architecture & Engineering Principles

This document outlines the key architectural decisions, engineering principles, and technical choices that shape Afiado.

## Core Engineering Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever optimizations
- Keep the codebase approachable for new contributors
- If a feature feels complex, it probably needs more design thinking

### 2. Type Safety is not optional
- Maintain strict type checking configurations
- Document type definitions clearly

### 3. Testing as a First-Class Citizen
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths
- Write tests that serve as documentation
- Follow the testing pyramid: unit → integration → e2e

### 4. Performance by Default
- Consider performance implications in every PR
- Optimize for core web vitals
- Regular performance monitoring and benchmarking

### 5. Mobile First UI
- Build for mobile first, then desktop
- Use responsive design patterns
- Optimize for touch interactions

### 6. Build Fast, Ship Faster
- Optimize build times, for both development and production
- The faster we can build, the faster we can ship
- Use CI/CD to automate builds and tests

### 7. We love open source
- Prefer open source tools and libraries
- Share our learnings with the community
- Keep the CHANGELOG up to date

## Technology Choices

For each technology choice, we will consider the following:

- Context: What is the problem we are trying to solve?
- Considered Alternatives: What other technologies did we consider?
- Decision Factors: What factors led to the choice of this technology?
- Consequences: What are the trade-offs of this technology?

### Frontend Framework: Next.js

**Context:**
- Need for a modern framework with recognizable patterns, helping new developers get up to speed quickly
- Looking for excellent developer experience
- Require strong TypeScript support

**Considered Alternatives:**
1. React Router (Framework Mode)
2. Nuxt
3. Solid Start
4. Tanstack Start

**Decision Factors:**
- Production-proven at scale
- Large, active community
- Built-in performance optimizations
- File-based routing
- API routes support
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Vercel's strong backing and support

**Consequences:**
- Positive:
  - Faster development cycles
  - Built-in performance optimizations
  - Great DX with hot reload
  - Strong ecosystem
- Negative:
  - Learning curve for developers new to Next.js
  - Some lock-in to Vercel's ecosystem
  - Need to follow Next.js upgrade cycles
